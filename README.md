Simple script for restoring "Open command prompt here" in Windows 10 Explorer Shell

Depends on library from https://usbtor.ru/viewtopic.php?t=1452 (thats using code by: https://github.com/jschicht/RunAsTI). Library included in /bin directory

Just Run script as Administrator and follow instruction.
